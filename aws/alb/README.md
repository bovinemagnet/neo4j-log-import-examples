# alb

## Overview

Contains various neo4j cypher scripts for dealing with AWS ALB Logs.  This is a play project for me, as I learn about graphs.  Looking for certain events in the ALB logs is the motivation, but I may not end up finishing it.

## File

The following files can be found here
- `alb_log_example.txt` : The example data provided by AWS for ALB logs
- `alb_log_header_example.txt` : The example data provided by AWS for ALB logs but with a header row
- `alb_data_load_simple_example.cql` : A simple example of loading the data into NEO4J. (using load csv)
